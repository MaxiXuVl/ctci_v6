-- JOIN = INNER JOIN => A and B intersection

-- LEFT JOIN = LEFT OUTER JOIN
--   all keys => A
--   B key is null => A - B

-- RIGHT JOIN = RIGHT OUTER JOIN
--   all keys => B
--   A key is null => B - A

-- FULL OUTER JOIN
--   all keys => A and B union
--   A key or B key are null => A and B without intersection
