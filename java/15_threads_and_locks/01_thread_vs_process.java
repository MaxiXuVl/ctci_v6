// Process - instance of a program execution
// OS resources allocated for process
// Process can address data from another process
// Inter-process communication - pipes, files, sockets, shared memory, etc.
// Process switching is expensive

// Threads run inside process
// Each threads has its own registers and stack
// Threads can access each other heap data and any process resources
// Switching Threads is expensive?
