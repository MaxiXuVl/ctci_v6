# BC - blue eyed pepole count
# BEP - blue eyed person
# NBEP - non blue eyed person
# BC at least 1
# Any BEP always see BC - 1 of BEP around
# Any NBEP always see BC of BEP around

# BC = 1
# day 1: BEP doesn't see any BEP around and conclude that he is BEP and leaving
# NBEP: see 1 BEP and wait

# BC = 2
# day 1: BEP see 1 BEP person around, NBEP see 2  BEP around, nobody leaves
# day 2: BEP still see 1 BEP around and conclude if nobody leaved yesterday he is second BEP
